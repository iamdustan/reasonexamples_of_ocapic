# OCaPIC  Examples with ReasonML

This repository was kicked off by [http://iamdustan.com/2017/02/21/using-ocapic-on-osx-with-reasonml/](http://iamdustan.com/2017/02/21/using-ocapic-on-osx-with-reasonml/).

It is a handful of the examples out of the [official OCaPIC tutorial](http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/web/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=ocapic-tutorial-1.2.pdf)
formatted in [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/) with a simple makefile
in each directory to build and run the example.

Assuming you have the correct toolchains installed (ocapic, reasonml, x11
server), you can simply run `make build` and `make emulate` in each example.
